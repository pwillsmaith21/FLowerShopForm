# FLowerShopForm
Create window form project using data collect from xml file and parse using linq
currently the code is functional but at this point I find that navigating through the code is quite difficut.
moving forward I will be learning how to write cleaner code that follow the SOLID which make the code more readable and easier to maintain and expand.
